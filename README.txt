Ensure each of the following java source files are within the same directory before attempting to compile:

	MyDate.java
	Time2.java
	DateAndTimeCombo.java
	SimpleTask.java

To compile, move to directory containing all above files within your preferred SHELL and use the command javac *.java. This will create class files for each of the java files listed above.

Javadocs for DateAndTimeCombo and SimpleTask can be found within the docs folder included in this commit.

JUnit tests have also been provided in DateAndTimeComboTest.java and SimpleTaskTest.java. To run the JUnit tests, in your preferred SHELL, navigate to the directory containing all above listed java source files and compile using javac *.java. Once code has compiled, use the command junit "JUnit Test File Name" and run.
